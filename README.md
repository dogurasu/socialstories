# SocialStory - Share your Story

SocialStory is a social media web application that allows users to sign up, write a story, and post it for others to be seen on the homepage. It was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and has its own custom Sass library. It isn't mobile responsive yet and is missing some features like being able to edit stories but its main functionality is there.

## How to run locally:
1. Clone this repo
2. In the root folder, run `npm install` to install dependencies for the server (backend)
3. Then navigate into the "client" folder and then run `npm install` once more to install frontend dependencies
4. Then run `npm run client` in the client folder and `npm run server` in the server folder (open another terminal or split into another window)
