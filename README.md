# SocialStory - Share your Story

SocialStory is a social media web application that allows users to sign up, write a story, and post it for others to be seen on the homepage. It was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and has its own custom Sass library. It isn't mobile responsive yet and is missing some features like being able to edit stories but its main functionality is there.
